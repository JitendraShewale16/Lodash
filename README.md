# Lodash - Important methods

#### _.assign Method
The _.assign method is the equivalent of the spread operator from ES6. It’s pretty easy to understand, it assigns properties of one or many objects to a source object.

#### _.first() and _.last() Methods
The _.first() functions return the first array element; the _.last() function returns the last array element.

#### _.find Method
Instead of iterating through an array with a loop to find a specific object, we can simply use a _.find method.

#### _.chunk() Method
The _.chunk() function creates an array of elements split into groups the length of the specified size.

#### _.slice() Method
The _.slice() method gets a slice from an array. It takes two indexes: the starting and ending index, where the starting index is inclusive and the ending is exclusive.

#### _.random() Method
The _.random() function produces random values between the inclusive lower and upper bounds.

#### _.keyBy Method
The _.keyBy is a very useful method. It helps a lot when trying to get an object with a specific property. Let’s say we have 100 users and we want to get the user with Id 1.

#### _.reduce Method
The _.reduce is a little bit like a filter function. The only difference is that you can choose the form of the returned object.

#### _.shuffle() Method
The _.shuffle() function shuffles a collection.

#### _.times Method
The _.times() executes the function n times.

#### _.delay function
The _.delay() function delays the execution of a function for the specified amount of milliseconds.

#### _.range Method
The Lodash _.range() function creates an array of numbers. The function accepts the start, end, and step parameters.

#### _.min and _.max() Methods
Lodash allows computing the maximum and minimum values of an array.

#### _.sum Method
The _.sum() function calculates the sum of array values.

####  String Case Methods
Lodash library contains several functions that work with the case of words.<br />
_.camelCase<br />
_.capitalize<br />
_.kebabCase<br />
_.lowerCase<br />
_.upperCase<br />


#### string _.startsWith and _.endsWith Methods
The _.startsWith() function determines if the string starts with the specified string.
The _.endsWith() function determines if the string ends with the specified string.

#### object keys and values
The _.keys() function returns an array of the property names of the JavaScript
object and the _.values() function returns an array of their values.

The _.forIn() function can be used to iterate over object properties.
